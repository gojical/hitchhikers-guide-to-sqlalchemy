##### Terminology:
* [`relationship`](http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/orm/relationship_api.html) : Creates the relationship between two classes `offence = relationship('Child')`
  * [`lazy`](http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/orm/relationship_api.html?highlight=lazy#sqlalchemy.orm.relationship.params.lazy) : if `True`, the *parent object* will be queried as well as all of the child objects, this means that the query is longer because it has to fetch all of the *child objects* related to the parent. More on this later üòè
  * [`backref`](http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/orm/relationship_api.html#sqlalchemy.orm.relationship.params.backref) : used to create *bidirectional* access to the parent model from the child model (MtO). backref as it sounds always refers to the name of the column that will be called from the child model to access the parent object eg: `backref='user'` this would be accessed as `child_obj.user` to retrieve the *Parent user object*.
  * [`back_populates`](http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/orm/relationship_api.html#sqlalchemy.orm.relationship.params.back_populates): works similar to backref, used to create an explicit relationship form child to parent. back_populates, as it sounds always refers to the *child object* relating to the *parent object*, eg: `back_populates='user'` this would be accessed the same a the eg. above.
* `Foreignkey` : A key that links two tables together. It's value is usually the parent `id`

##### Standard file layout for these examples :


> üöë The following examples were run in a *virtual environment* with `sqlalchemy` installed.

```python
from sqlalchemy import create_engine, Table, Column, Integer, ForeignKey, Sequence, String
from sqlalchemy.orm import relationship, sessionmaker
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base

# base class for all of the models
Base = declarative_base()

######################
#    models go here  #
######################

# create a sqlite database in memory and show me the raw sql queries(echo=True)
engine = create_engine('sqlite:///:memory:', echo=True)

# create all of the tables
Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)

# start session
Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine)
session = Session()

###############################

##### A. [One to Many](http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/orm/basic_relationships.html#one-to-many) :

###### Definition:
A *Parent table* can have a (OtM) relationship with a *child table*, however this relationship **is not bidirectional** in it's simplest form, the *parent* can access the data in the *child* table with a defined `relationship`. The child table holds a `ForeignKey` that references the parent's key in order to filter out which records to return.

> üöë You can make OtM relationships bidirectional, see [`back_populates`](https://github.com/librelad/SQLAlchemy-Guide/blob/master/relationships/a_2_one_to_many_back_populates.py) and [`backref`](https://github.com/librelad/SQLAlchemy-Guide/blob/master/relationships/a_3_one_to_many_backref.py) examples in the [relationships folder](https://github.com/librelad/SQLAlchemy-Guide/tree/master/relationships).

###### Example:

```python
from sqlalchemy import create_engine, Table, Column, Integer, ForeignKey, Sequence, String
from sqlalchemy.orm import relationship, sessionmaker
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base

# base class for all of the models
Base = declarative_base()

class Person(Base):
    '''
    A simple person model with name and offences columns the id is the primary key.
    '''
    __tablename__ = 'persons'
    id = Column(Integer, Sequence('person_seq'), primary_key=True)
    name = Column(String(50), nullable=False)
    offences = relationship('Offence')

class Offence(Base):
    '''
    Offence that are logged against a person.
    '''
    __tablename__ = 'offences'
    id = Column(Integer, Sequence('offences_seq'), primary_key=True)
    description = Column(String(50), unique=True)
    person_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('persons.id'))

# create a sqlite database in memory, add kwarg echo=True to the the
# raw SQL queries SQLA generates
engine = create_engine('sqlite:///:memory:')

# create all of the tables
Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)

# start session
Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine)

session = Session()

# create a peson and add them to the session
libre_lad = Person(name="L. Lad")

# session.add(obj) will add the object to the session
session.add(libre_lad)

# note that when you do a query it commits the changes to the database
# before fetchinig the object
libre_lad = session.query(Person).filter(Person.name == 'L. Lad').first()

# add an offence and supply it with a person_id
offence = Offence(description="Farting in public.", person_id=libre_lad.id)
session.add(offence)

# add an offence and supply it with a person_id
offence = Offence(description="Looking up skirts.", person_id=libre_lad.id)
session.add(offence)

# add an offence and supply it with a person_id
offence = Offence(description="Stealing from the homeless.", person_id=libre_lad.id)
session.add(offence)

# this offence has no person_id, however since we didnt make person_id
# NOT NULL(nullable=False) this is allowed...
offence = Offence(description="Public nudity.")
session.add(offence)

# lets fetch the person object from the DB
person = session.query(Person).filter(Person.id == 1).first()

# a small test to see if we get the offecnes of the selected user.
print "%s's Offence:" % person.name
for offence in person.offences:
    print "offence: %s" % offence.description

# commit object to the database and close the session
session.commit()
session.close()

```

###### Notes:
`ForeignKey`'s link to a field (table.column). `relationship`'s link to Models.

---

##### B. [Many to One](http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/orm/basic_relationships.html#many-to-one) :

###### Definition:
Both the `ForeignKey` and the `relationship` are in the parent model to create a relationship with the child model. There is no object mapping (ForeginKey) in the child model. **Many** parent objects can link to **one** specific child object.  

> üöë You can make MtO relationships bidirectional, see [`back_populates`](https://github.com/librelad/SQLAlchemy-Guide/blob/master/relationships/b_2_many_to_one_back_populates.py) and [`backref`](https://github.com/librelad/SQLAlchemy-Guide/blob/master/relationships/b_3_many_to_one_backref.py) examples in the relationships folder.

###### Example:

```python
from sqlalchemy import create_engine, Table, Column, Integer, ForeignKey, Sequence, String
from sqlalchemy.orm import relationship, sessionmaker
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base

# base class for all of the models
Base = declarative_base()

class Person(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'person'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = Column(String, nullable=False, unique=True)
    website_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('website.id'))
    website = relationship('Website')

class Website(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'website'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    url = Column(String, nullable=False)

# create a sqlite database in memory and show me the sql queries(echo=True)
engine = create_engine('sqlite:///:memory:')

# create all of the tables
Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)

# start session
Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine)
session = Session()

# create a website object
foot_fetish = Website(url="https://ffetish.co/no_idea_where_this_leads")

# add object to sesssion
session.add(foot_fetish)

# fetch object from session
session.query(Website).filter(Website.id == 1).first()

# create person object relating to foot_fetish object
person1 = Person(name="Jeff", website_id=foot_fetish.id)
person2 = Person(name="Jeruska", website_id=foot_fetish.id)
person3 = Person(name="Bongani", website_id=foot_fetish.id)

# add persons to the session
session.add(person1)
session.add(person2)
session.add(person3)

# lets test our many to one by looking for the site url for Jeff
person_query = session.query(Person).filter(Person.name == "Jeff").first()

# accessing the one website from the person object
print "%s has been visiting" % person_query.name
print person_query.website.url

# commit object to the database and close the session
session.commit()
session.close()
```

###### Notes:
`ForeignKey` and `relationship` are both in the parent model, the child model has no knowledge of the relationship.

---

##### Lazy:

If you dont use the lazy keyword areguemt and you query the parent object from the database, it will only retreve the person object. if you call the relationship in the person object to get all of the child objects, that will run a second select query to fetch all of the child objects related to the parent.

##### And you're done...
